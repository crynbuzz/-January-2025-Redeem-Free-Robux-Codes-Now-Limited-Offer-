Roblox: Easy Ways To Get Robux Free
1. Design Custom Clothing
If you have a creative side then you should consider starting your own Roblox avatar clothing brand. You can create pants, shirts, and t-shirts for avatars which players can purchase in the store.
2. A Membership
If you sign up for a premium membership then you are automatically given a stipend of so many Robux each month. If you pay $4.99 per month then you will receive 450 Robux, while those paying $9.99 a month will be given 1,000 Robux per month.
The highest tier will charge you $19.99 a month and you will be given 2,200 Robux which is more than enough to have fun with and buy expensive limited items.
3. Microsoft Rewards
Microsoft Rewards are essentially tasks that reward you with Robux. As you complete tasks, you will be rewarded with points that can be redeemed for a reward. To get 100 Robux, you will need 1,500 points. This may sound like a lot, but some tasks reward a hefty amount of points. For example, you can answer questions on ‘This or That?’ and earn up to 50 points.
4. PLS DONATE
PLS DONATE is a unique game that allows you to donate Robux to other players. More often than not, you will be dealing with small amounts of Robux, as shown in the image above.
By logging in daily and donating, you can earn Giftbux, which can be used to purchase items such as a donation booth. It’s important to note that prior to setting up your booth, you will need to create a Gamepass to sell. Here, you can check out a quick tutorial on how to do so.
5. Purchase Robux
Finally, you can purchase Robux if the membership doesn’t give you enough. The price intervals for purchasing Robux in bulk are the same as membership prices. You will pay $4.99 for 400 Robux, $9.99 for 800 Robux, or $19.99 for 1,700 Robux.
Subscribing to the monthly membership is a slightly better deal if you only plan to purchase Robux once a month. We recommend purchasing the Roblox membership first before you begin to purchase Robux in bulk. If the amount you get for the membership is not enough, you can always buy more.
6. Honorable Mention: Building A Game
Although this isn’t really ‘easy’, you can also earn Robux by building your own game
If your game has a following then Roblox will use a metric to see how many premium players often play this game, and then you will be rewarded with a stipend. Below, you can check out some features in your game that can help you get even more Robux.
Encourage Non-Premium Players to Upgrade
Host Paid Events
Enable Private Game Servers
Create Items That Can Be Bought Multiple Times
Create One Time Purchases
Sell Access To Your Game
Overall, making a game is not an easy process. We recommend taking a look at other popular games on Roblox to see how yours measures up. If your game seems like it would do well, then give it a go and make it!
Although it is not technically free, you can earn free Robux from a monthly subscription called Roblox Premium. If you get the premium you will get a certain amount of Robux on every renewal date. This comes with a lot of additional perks such as in-game items, discounts, and the ability to trade.
How much does Robux cost?
The cost of Robux changes depending on how much Robux you want to purchase. It can vary from just a few dollars to 100 USD.
Are there any limitations on using Robux?
Robux can unlock various features and content but some games may have specific requirements such as age and content restrictions.
Are there any free Robux or membership generators?
No, there are no such free Robux generators nor are there any such things for memberships.
